I will never forget when I fell in love with the beauty of data analytics through oil trucks.

In the first quarter of 2021, I witnessed the nightmare of the oil supply crisis. Many gas stations had a lack of fuel stock to sell. Accordingly, public demonstrations happened for nearly five weeks afterward. As the oil supply from both local and foreign sources is limited, an efficient operation scheme is needed to balance the demand effectively. To overcome the situation, Pertamina created a task force to improve the operation scheme by evaluating how the oil trucks distribute the oil. Using K-Means as the algorithm, we managed to cluster all of the oil trucks based on some clustering variables (ie. number of compartments, carrying capacity, speed, driver performance, traffic jam hours, road width, etc.). As a result, we found some vehicles are unreliable for particular territories, affecting an inefficient distribution scheme. Based on this data analysis, we executed the new operation scheme successfully ten days.

In 2017, I read an article from The Economist that said data would be the new oil. Since then, I have been preparing myself to be a data analyst by taking related courses in my undergraduate studies, such as probability and statistics, discrete structure, etc. My first project related to data analysis during college was an underwater data acquisition through a remotely operated vehicle. I continually honed my data-related skills by taking licenses, such as Python programming (Indonesia Ai), Structured Query Language (Udemy), and Tableau Data Visualization (Udemy). I am very interested in exploring how data can solve real-world challenges and find hidden insights that would be valuable. Moreover, my inquisitive mind pushes me further to explore more interesting domains such as predictive analysis, big data, and artificial intelligence. As a result of all my continuous learning, I managed to become The First Winner in Indonesia's National Data Science Competition held by Datacamp in 2021.


As a part of my working experience, I gained familiarity with data analytics. During my period as a consulting sales engineer at Keyence Corp., I evaluated the competitiveness of our product through market analysis, competitor mapping, and industrial forecasts. In my next career at the Supply and Distribution Division in Pertamina, I had to maintain the energy supply and demand, which involved a lot of data analysis. I believe those previous experiences further support me in having strong analytical thinking and being well-versed with several data processing tools or programming languages such as Microsoft Excel, TensorFlow, and Tableau.


I always believe that data is a powerful asset, but it is often hidden within mighty walled gardens. When I had a project to analyze and forecast the recovery of the tourism sector in Indonesia after the pandemic COVID-19, it took me around one week just to get data from The Indonesia Statistical Center (Badan Pusat Statistik). This is the epitome of the concerning data ecosystem in Indonesia. In addition, comprehensive knowledge of data science is provided only by the limited institution. Therefore, I needed to find other sources like online courses, webinars, and books to gain more knowledge in data science. Even though I am confident in my self-study, I believe formal education provides a deeper understanding of statistical theory and mathematics, two critical aspects that are quite rare to be found in informal courses.


For that reason, I choose MSc in Statistics (Data Science) at Imperial College London. This course is appealing because not only learning core computational skills but also learning rare things that are industry oriented, such as stochastic processes and the Bayesian method. Having previously taken a lot of courses related to practical data analysis,  I am sure this program will sharpen my data processing competency with multiple fundamentals of statistical theories and broaden my technical skills in predictive analysis. This course has been accredited by the Royal Statistical Society, which will help my future career as a data scientist due to this recognition. In addition to compulsory modules, I plan to enroll in stochastic processes because the petroleum industry manages a high degree of uncertainty in business and operation. By advancing it, I will grow the company by lowering the risk of investment and operation. Besides my studies, I intend to join the Imperial Entrepreneurs Student Union since I always dream of having a consulting firm with a specialization in statistical analysis in the future. The community offers a mentorship program, connecting participants with other students with the same interest, admired entrepreneurs, and investors. By exchanging various ideas and working with people of the same spirit, it will be a beneficial experience to shape my future. As a world-class university that always stands among the top ten educational institutions in the world, I am confident that Imperial College London can help me build an excellent foundation of data science, and capably solve problems across industries as a data scientist.


After completing the degree, I plan to return to my current company, Pertamina, as a data scientist. With all the comprehensive data knowledge during the study, I believe it will be beneficial since most oil and gas companies are currently doing digital and renewable energy transformations. Although the efficiency is higher for renewable, the initial cost is still one of the hardest bottlenecks to implementing a renewable energy business. As a requirement for a steady renewable transition, data-driven decision-making at every step is essential. In 10 years, I wish to be Indonesia's leading expert in data science to support the unfolding Indonesia 4.0, as data has been one of the five priority sectors in the national roadmap.


In conclusion, the unique and comprehensive program of MSc Statistics (Data Science) at Imperial College London will significantly help me achieve my goals as a data science expert in Indonesia. My past experiences dealing with a lot of data and the rare perspective of energy companies hopefully enrich the points of view and discussion during coursework. If I get this opportunity, I will utilize the experience, knowledge, and network I gained to make a better Indonesia through the beauty of data analytics. For those reasons, I hope to be considered a strong candidate for the program.
